Merck faces punitive phase of Vioxx trial
Merck shares fell nearly 4 percent to $34.57 in early trade on Thursday, a day after the jury in Atlantic City, New Jersey, found that Vioxx had been a substantial contributing cause of a heart attack suffered by John McDarby. The jury determined the drug was not a significant cause of a heart attack suffered by a second plaintiff, Thomas Cona.
