Giuliani to testify at 9/11 trial
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who led the city through the dark days after the September 11 attacks, will be among the first witnesses when the death penalty trial of Zacarias Moussaoui resumes today. In addition, the lone cockpit voice recorder recovered from the four hijacked planes will be played publicly for the first time, the judge has ruled.
