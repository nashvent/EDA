Triple bombing kills 74 at mosque
Three suicide bombers attacked a Baghdad mosque affiliated with a major Shiite political party Friday, killing at least 74 people, according to the Iraqi Health Ministry. One bomber blew himself up outside the mosque and in the ensuing panic, the two others, disguised as women, ran with the crowd toward the mosque before detonating suicide vests.
