Giuliani takes stand at 9/11 trial
Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who led New York through the dark days after the September 11 terrorist attacks, took the witness stand for the government today in the death penalty trial of Zacarias Moussaoui. Prosecutors told jurors it was time for them to "hear the voices" and learn of the suffering caused by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
