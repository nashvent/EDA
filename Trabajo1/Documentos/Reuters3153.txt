Madonna set to rough it in the California desert
LOS ANGELES (Amusement Business) - Madonna's not in the habit of performing at rock festivals. In fact, the Material Girl's never played any festivals. So it's understandable that the pop diva's recent addition to the April 29-30 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in southern California might've caused a double take or two.
