Cozy up to Lake Powell
Sapphire sky, pink stone, turquoise water. Three extravagances of nature -- each one deep and intense and starkly beautiful in itself -- intersect at Lake Powell, the West's most provocative spectacle. A manmade 186-mile-long footprint spanning Utah and Arizona, the lake is often plied by houseboats in spring and summer, but there's a much richer experience waiting for the active traveler.
