Romney and a health plan
Massachusetts is close to adopting a plan for near-universal health coverage for all its citizens -- funded by a mix of individuals, businesses, and government subsidies. If Gov. Mitt Romney decides to seek the presidency, this plan is likely to attract the attention of states across the country; it not only suggests a way out of the most daunting fiscal pressure the states face, but the near-unanimous votes in both houses of the Legislature also suggest a way to find consensus out of conflict.
