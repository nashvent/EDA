Sheriff: Online sex suspect waives extradition
A press aide at the Department of Homeland Security was suspended without pay Wednesday after being arrested on charges of trying to seduce a child online.  Brian Doyle allegedly confessed and has agreed to extradition to Florida -- where an officer had posed as a 14-year-old girl in sex chats with Doyle, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said.
