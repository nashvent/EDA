Satellite navigation finds its way to phones
AMSTERDAM   - It's Friday, 10 p.m. Do you know where your friends are?  You could give them a call, but if their mobile phones are equipped with the latest in satellite navigation, you could also go to a Web site such as Mologogo (www.mologogo.com) to find their whereabouts on a map, accurate to within a few yards.
