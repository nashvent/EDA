Maternal weight linked to risk of preterm delivery
Dr. Patricia M. Dietz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, and colleagues examined the effects of pregnancy weight gain on preterm delivery. They used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, collected in 21 states, which included 113,802 women who delivered a single baby between 1996 and 2001.
